# network-based-candidate-gene-predictor
Here is a Python program that's used to predict the function of unknown proteins in PPI networks. This program uses NetworkX to create the graph objects from a PPI network file from the STRING database, given as a .txt format file. This program provides options for predicting the candidate gene for single or multiple functions.
